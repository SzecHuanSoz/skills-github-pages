# First Github Blog

So for today, I'm trying to learn how GitHub Pages work. I've already learned about the basics of GitHub and communicating using markdown yesterday.

What I understand about GitHub pages is that it can contain any static content. 

From what I understood, this is where people create their own blog sites and store anything they want as long as its static.
